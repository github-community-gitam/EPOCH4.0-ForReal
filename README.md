**Cloning a Figma Wireframe to Frontend**
This project focuses on converting a static Figma wireframe into a fully responsive and functional frontend interface. The goal is to accurately replicate layout, spacing, typography, color systems, and interactions defined in the wireframe using best frontend practices.

**Objective**

Transform a Figma wireframe into a clean, maintainable frontend UI

Ensure design accuracy and consistency across devices

Apply modern UI development principles and component structuring

Maintain scalability for future design and feature updates

**What This Project Covers** 

Layout implementation (grid, spacing, alignment)

Typography and color system replication

Components and reusable UI blocks

Responsive breakpoints and adaptive behavior

Interaction mapping (hover, click, transitions)

Asset extraction and optimization from Figma

**Workflow Overview**

Analyze the Figma wireframe

Extract style tokens and assets

Build layout structure

Convert wireframe components into coded components

Add styling, responsiveness, and interactions

Review for pixel-perfect accuracy

Validate accessibility and UI consistency

**Deliverables**

Fully cloned frontend layout

Component-based structure

Responsive design ready for integration

Documentation outlining structure and decisions

**Tools (Recommended)**

Figma for design reference

Any frontend stack (HTML/CSS/JS, React, Vue, or your choice)

Browser DevTools for alignment and accuracy checking

**Roadmap**

Add design-to-code automation workflow

Build a style guide from the Figma design

Include accessibility guidelines

Provide a reusable component library
